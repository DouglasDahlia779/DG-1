# The Basic problem 

The basic problem in the world is that we see ourself as separate and apart. This creates fear and fosters isolation. 

The aim of the lessons in ACIM is to change your way of seeing yourself in the world, so that you will eventually include everything as being within you. see: [[Workbook Plan]]
