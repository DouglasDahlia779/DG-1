[[Let go of Control]]

‚úèÔ∏è one can only control a body in the mind where it is imagined. In the real world control has no meaning as there are no separate objects.

# Do this

see [[Split Mind]]

>Pause and be still a little while, and see how far you rise above the world, when you release your mind from chains and let it seek the level where it finds itself at home. It will be grateful to be free a while. It knows where it belongs. But free its wings, and it will fly in sureness and in joy to join its holy purpose. Let it rest in its Creator, there to be restored to sanity, to freedom and to love. -ACIM Lesson-128

"the Light" = "Beingness" = "Presence"

# dream
2024-05-26 dream last night
I went and met Garry Rondeau and woke him up. I told him that I wanted a witch-doctor and travel back to god,,, to the transcendent reality. He asked me if I wanted to think more good thoughts, or something on those lines; I said no, that I wanted to experience god/become one with it; this made him uneasy, and I realized that I may never come back the way I am now; 

I woke up and remembered the dream at that point, wanting to go back into it, but I only imagined going into a dark room this no electricity, like the caves of Lascaux ... the dream to be continued ?

[[Being within (self abiding)]]

2024-05-12



In one of Rupert's meditations he asks us to allow your experience without controlling it in any way. --That's a hard request. We simply want to jump into the experience and be in it rather than to be and surround it.


Who is that arrogant one who wants to control, to feel the bodies sensations, to feel the blood flowing? Does this activity of the separated mind hide the fear of returning to our natural state?

# Where do I get Stuck?

We get stuck in belief and in pleasure.

[[Our belief creates our box]]

[[Pleasure gets us Stuck in the body experience.]]

# Son of Man

"Son of man" idea may have been explained by ACOL in that Jesus wants us to see God's son in everyone and they will then act like it.

> [!NOTE all objects I see are illuminated by my attention... see this now]


Sept 7 2023, a few days ago I was thinking about Rupert's meditation where one's experience is illuminated by Awareness, and then I saw clearly how I was indeed everything I was seeing in the world was a reflection of me.  It is like the [[The Lord's Prayer from ACIM]] "and we would look upon, the glorious reflection of Your Love, which shines in everything." 

see: [[I Am Quotes ‚ô•Ô∏è]] number 26 (the "I AM," the one witness reflects itself in the countless bodies)

If you forget something...
Today I wanted to write "inventory" but lost the word and could not find it. I went to Presence until the person remembered it. then later I read: 

>Go deep into the sense of ‚ÄòI am‚Äô and you will find. How do you find a thing you have mislaid or forgotten? You keep it in your mind until you recall it. [[Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj]]    from [[I Am Quotes ‚ô•Ô∏è]]

## a unified goal

2022-11-07
This was cleanup day. Time to get rid of the collections of men and bodies. It is a decision to move towards unity rather than in multiple directions at once. A Unified Goal will serve me better than fragmented goals. 

A unified goal is an example of right-thinking. It's a direction of seeing. Inward rather than outward. 

I watched the video about when Mooji went before Papaji, [when Mooji went before Papaji](file:///Volumes/Drobo/Obsidian_Vault/Spirit/Mooji%201/Mooji%20meets%20Papaji%20first%20time%201993%20(Story%20+%20Footage).mp4)

and [another one about Papaji ](file:///Volumes/Drobo/Obsidian_Vault/Spirit/Mooji%201/PAPAJI%20-%20Call%20Off%20The%20Search%20(Full%20Documentary)/PAPAJI%20-%20Call%20Off%20The%20Search%20(Full%20Documentary).mp4)

and found them both very moving. Mooji is a great example of someone who is searching in earnest for 'freedom' as he puts it.

## duped by the ego

[[2022-09-16]] Just as HWA was duped by his ego, I too am duped, otherwise I would only have one goal. Why don't I do it the way Jesus says, and not my own way? The authority problem. 

## why be the branch cut off from the vine? (the ego rather than Awareness)
When I can choose to be in Presence, why live in ego-land ?

‚úèÔ∏è If I am attending a talk by Mooji or Rupert, or others, don't create a self "looking for some future state" --I am already that.

[[Thinking -My Mythology,  My Thought System]]

[[Synchronicity_dc|see the synchronicity in my life]]

## dealing with Negativity
Negativity is a form of suffering. How to deal with suffering: look at who is seeing it. The person? What is it giving the person? 

## temptation

All temptation is wanting more sensations, more music, more beautiful things, more men... looking for salvation in the world of objects.

If I am plowing towards the KofG, keep on the course, keep the line straight, if I go back into past ideas and search in the world for fullness, the borough will not be straight. As Jesus says "don't look back." At the same time realize that in being, we have everything already and there is no loss and nothing real that needs to be given up.  

‚úèÔ∏è temptation = choosing black or white in the world view, rather than the inner heart view, the watcher from within. ACIM makes the point that in the world you are forced to choose from different things, but they are all false things. (find this ...) The world is an illusion I made/make up. It would not be if I were not there to see it. Be the "I am" without any descriptive coloring. No form. 

‚úèÔ∏è The ego directs you in every direction except inward. It looks into objective reality, outside yourself so that you do not look at yourself. Real change comes from a change in direction from outside to inside. It is the seer inside that needs to become your teacher, not the ego body/mind that plays outside in the world. 

If I listen to both, my mind will be split about what reality is. ACIM T-8-1.6

üëçüèø The field of Awareness is God, in whom we have our being
[[this was in a meditation from Rupert Spira]]

üëçüèø The ego directs you in every direction except inward. It looks into objective reality outside yourself so that you do not look at yourself. 

üëçüèø Real change comes from a change in direction from looking outward to looking inward. 

üëçüèø It is the seer inside that needs to become your teacher not the ego body/mind that plays outside in the world. 

If I listen to both the ego and the HS my mind will be split about what reality is ACIM T816

üëçüèø Happiness is Consciousness finding itself. We are happy when we stop looking for happiness. the next time an urge for pleasure comes, try to follow the urge into Beingness.


üëçüèø Awareness ignores itself when it's thinking. To Awareness, the act of thinking is [[Rupert -Ignorance, what it is]] in this sense. (Rupert Spira meditation)


Jesus was enlightened and tried to give the same experience to his disciples. A few got it, but the majority did not. History shows that they went their own way and created a religion of mind ideas deeply based on their past Jewish ideas. If one reads the book of Matthew, we don't read that Matthew is enlightened, because he talks about the Kingdom of Heaven, but doesn't know really what it is. (Matt 5:12 followers should rejoice if they are persecuted because great will be their reward in heaven...) He seems to ignore that Jesus said the Kingdom was at hand and it was inside you.

LESSON 126: All that I give is given to myself. This is why forgiveness is a gift to myself. This is why an attack is an attack on myself. 

Matt. 6:2 "don't let your right hand know what your left hand gives" Jesus in a discussion about how to give. The idea here is to give without a "doer" so that no one is better. We are equals because I give to myself alone. 

[[ACIM Workbook#^d8436e|All that I give, I give to myself]]


- ACIM says that if I believed this, this would be thought reversal.

[[The Body]]


-   Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful and the holy.„ÄêT-1.VII.2„Äë
-   As your function in Heaven is creation, so your function on earth is healing. 8 God shares His function with you in Heaven, and the Holy Spirit shares His with you on earth.9 As long as you believe you have other functions, so long will you need correction.„ÄêT-12.VII.4„Äë

Lesson 236
>I have a kingdom I must rule. At times, it does not seem I am its king at all. It seems to triumph over me, and tell me what to think, and what to do and feel. And yet it has been given me to serve whatever purpose I perceive in it. My mind can only serve. Today I give its service to the Holy Spirit to employ as He sees fit. I thus direct my mind, which I alone can rule. And thus I set it free to do the Will of God.

>Father, my mind is open to Your Thoughts, and closed today to every thought but Yours. I rule my mind, and offer it to You. Accept my gift, for it is Yours to me.


Dec 4, 2021. It hit me today that the experience of "Presence" is what ACIM calls the [[Holy Spirit MOC Stage 1|Holy Spirit]]


"[Attention](app://obsidian.md/Attention)"

ACIM T-7.III.4. **To be in the Kingdom** is merely to focus your full attention on it (mind); ‚úèÔ∏èit's an awareness outside of the body, but sees the body. It is an experience that "I am in the mind of god" 

[don't look for the Presence](app://obsidian.md/don't%20look%20for%20the%20Presence) Meditation is to relax your focus on objects to simply be aware of yourself (mind), i.e. the Kingdom.
