>And all our suffering, and by suffering, please understand I don't mean pain, I don't mean resistance that arises on behalf of the safety or the well-being of the body, of our body, or the body of one who is in our care. I don't consider that to be suffering. --Rupert

So pain is the resistance that arises on behalf of the safety or well-being of the body.

>And one of the ways to distinguish between the two, if you are in any doubt, is that physical pain or or distress, that is, resistance that arises on behalf of the safety or well-being of the body, does not require the support of thinking.
