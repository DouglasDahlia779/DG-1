Thinking is the cause of all the psychological pain in the world. It is the cause of war, the cause of man made misery. Driven by fear, it can completely take over an person and cause them and others untold misery. In these cases, thought has taken over the person, and the person believes he is the thinker of the thoughts.

>"There are still millions of people out there who don't know that there's a voice in the head that never stops speaking because they are so identified with the voice that they have become it. There is no separation. There is no awareness. There is no presence. Their entire consciousness is trapped in thought. So that is and that is the state of being trapped in your personality."... Every thought has a sense of self in it. You identify with every thought that comes into your head and you believe in every thought that comes into your head. 

>This is the case if there's no awareness whatsoever, then that is your fate. Then awareness is the dormant faculty, presence, awareness, whatever you want to call it, that's the dormant faculty in you. It's still dormant. And as long as it's completely dormant, you are totally in the grip of your conditioned personality and your conditioned mind.  -[[Eckart Tolle -on Zen "Emptiness"]]

Given that people are taken over by their thoughts, can they direct them, or are thoughts directing themselves for their own purpose? (a pre-coded Avatar in a computer game.) 

[[Reality -the world is a Simulation]]

If the thoughts are directing themselves, [[there is no free will]]. If the person can still direct some thoughts, then there may be a little [[free will]]. If the person has full control over his thoughts, he has [[free will.]]

Given that people believe they exist as separate entities, and that they move about in bodies, and interact with other entities both in their minds as well as with their bodies, 

What is the role of [[purpose]] and [[direction]] in the process of thinking?  Do these contribute to the creation of time?

Does thinking have a goal on it's own? -to stay out of Being. -to build and support the individual identity

If thinking is used correctly, it can be used by a person to watch their own thoughts, and to recognize if thoughts are motivated by fear or love. 

Watching one's thoughts eventually breaks the identity link to the thoughts. 

At first, a person thinks that the thoughts they have are "their thoughts." There is an ownership to them. There is a specialness to them. Most of them are actually opinions they hold about things in their life situation. Some are held to define their own self identity. "I am not like so and so," I am a vegetarian, I am a vegan, I am an Italian. I hate... I love... 

The individual has created an idea of himself that is carried around with him and is always talking, comparing new ideas to his collection of likes and dislikes, and expressing them to everyone they meet in order to uphold this idea of themselves.

Watching thoughts brings this into one's awareness. 

Once you realize that you are not your thoughts, thinking has become a gift.
