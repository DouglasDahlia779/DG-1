## Language is like a fence around an individual ego

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">-✏️a language layer built around the sense of self. It is like the guard rails around an ai agent. Thinking therefore is a box around the Self. It is what creates the sense of an ICU (Individual Consciousness Unit) It causes distortions in everything that we see.</mark>

✏️ the guard rails of the ICU is the language used to communicate and think. The language provides the limits to the ICU as it can not "think" outside the concepts built by the words of the language.

De Bono also said that the goal of thinking was to stop thinking. 
- To the ego the purpose is survival. Thus the proclivity to think about and imagine the future.
