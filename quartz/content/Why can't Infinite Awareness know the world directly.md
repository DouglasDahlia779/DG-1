## Why can't Infinite Awareness know the world directly?

Why does it need to know the the world or the universe?

via the through the point of view or through via the agency of a finite mind and the answer is is simply this Try to imagine what the universe would look like if it was perceived directly by infinite awareness.

In fact, to make this simpler, try to imagine what a single object would look like if it was perceived directly by infinite awareness.

Now Take any object. Let's take a tree. Imagine a tree and take an image of that tree from a single point of view. And now walk to the other side of the tree and take a second image. of the same tree from a second point of view. We now have two images of the tree. and now walk slowly round the tree, and every ten paces stop and take an image of the tree. By the time you get round to the place from which you started, we now have twenty images of the tree. Now, superimpose all those images on top of one another and imagine what the image would look like.
Would it look like a tree? No, it would be a chaos of shapes and colors and lines.

And now imagine taking an image of the tree from every single location in space. including all those locations within the tree itself. We now have billions, a countless number, of images, and superimpose them on top of one another.

And imagine what that image would look like. It would just be blackness, dense, dark, deep blackness. That's what the universe would look like if awareness were able to perceive it directly.

In other words, it would not be able to perceive the universe directly, in order to perceive an object, and by extension the universe, as a single thing.

Or as a coherent thing, it must do so from a single point of view.

Hence the need to localize itself as a finite mind, that is, each of us from whose perspective, or through whose agency It perceives itself as the universe.

The [[finite mind]], that is, each of us, is a It's a bundle of thinking and perceiving. Through which awareness perceives itself as the universe.

The [[finite mind]] is as such not an entity, it is not a thing.

It is an activity of infinite awareness, just as the character that we seem to become in a dream.

From whose perspective we view the dreamed world is not an entity inside our own mind.

It is simply the localized activity of our own mind.

I hope I'm not losing anyone.

So understand that you, the finite mind, are Not a a discrete and independently existing entity in your own right.

You are the localized activity of thinking and perceiving.

Through which, or in the form of which, infinite awareness is able to Actualize a segment of its infinite potential in form.

Now, it's very important to understand that the activity of thinking and perceiving does not create the universe.

This would be conventional idealism or leading to solipsism.

The faculties, the finite mind, that is the faculty of thinking and perceiving, is the means by which The pre-existing reality, because reality, infinite consciousness, pre-exists the finite mind appears as the world.
