## The Purpose of Thinking

- To the Spirit, the purpose of thinking is the dissolution of separateness.

[[de Bono]] saw that the mind is self-organizing, and looks for patterns, and once one is identified, it goes into an "automatic mode" which he says evolved as a self-preservation tactic. 

✏️ the mind is always busy. Thats why we get tired. It is always doing "pattern searches" to find evidence of it's opinions and "truths." A part is always looking out to protect the [[ICU]]. This part is not even in the awareness of the [[ICU]], but is active nevertheless. 

- The mind can look for patterns that are built on fear, or built on Littleness, or patterns that try to create and define the ego... "I am..." It will look for anything we want to see.

- The "thinking" is actually trying to recognize and make sense of patterns of sensory, thought,  and memory information.

For example, "jump and run "(if we sense fear, see a snake), or "jump to an opinion" if we believe some past impression.  

✏️Maybe everything we call "thinking" is simply pattern-making in a large complex system. 

The fact that mathematics can simulate physical-world events suggests that maybe thinking is deterministic. (not caused by the personal will)
  
Even AI "intelligence" is simply pattern making using statistical analysis.
