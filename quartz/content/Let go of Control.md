<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Q- Why does Rupert start off by not wanting us to control our experience in any way? 
Patangali answers this in 1.4 [[Patanjali Yoga Sutras#Unity]] Unity obtains when the activities of the mind have stopped. "otherwise the witness is identified with the activities of the mind and is just another thought form"</mark>


Control of the body must then be a magic act by the mind to keep us believing we are this ego.

[[The Illusion of Conscious Will]]
