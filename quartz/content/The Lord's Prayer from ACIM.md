Our Father, bless our eyes today,
We are Your messengers; 
and we would look upon, the glorious reflection of Your Love, 
which shines in everything.   
We live and move in You alone,

We are not separate from Your Eternal life,
There is NO DEATH, for death is not your will,
And we abide, where you have placed us,
In the life we share with You, and with All living things,
To be like You
And a part of You, forever.

We accept Your will as ours' 
And our will is One with your's eternally

Amen

✏️ this directly denies the base assumptions of the body in the world --"the dream" -- [[the Experience of a Personal Reality]] and forces us to step back to the "seer of the dream" - the awareness.

see: [[Gospel of Thomas -notes]] 

(1) And he said, "Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not experience death."

-✏️God is not an object in the world. God is the light -Awareness, i.e. what we see with.

-we need to sink back into awareness and go to the place where division of the mind occurred ... awareness/"i am"

-can the seer be seen?

from Rupert: [[Rupert -Awareness and the body prison]]

>Meditation or prayer is simply to be only being. to be only being, to know only being, and to love only being. It's good to set aside formal periods of meditation or prayer each day such as this one, where we give our exclusive love and attention to simply being.
