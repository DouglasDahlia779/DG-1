## Does Action arise from thoughts?

-do all human actions arise from thoughts? -no
- many movements of the body arise from thoughts (conscious movements)
- unconscious activities like one's heart beating (these just happen without thought)

If an action does not arise from a thought, it could not have its own purpose. (the movement of the wind)
If an action does arise from a thought, it must have a purpose.

If the moon circling the earth did not begin by a thought, how could it have a purpose?
We might **impute a purpose to it**, or impute a Creator and His purpose to it, but we can never be sure that this was the purpose. Therefore, imputed purposes can never be trusted as being true.
