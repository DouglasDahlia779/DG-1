>T-24.in.1. Forget not that the motivation for this course is the attainment and the keeping of the state of peace. Given this state the mind is quiet, and the condition in which God is remembered is attained.

Q- Why does Rupert start off by not wanting us to control our experience in any way? 

### Patanjali

Patangali answers this in 1.4 [[Patanjali Yoga Sutras#Unity]] Unity obtains when the activities of the mind have stopped. "otherwise the witness is identified with the activities of the mind and is just another thought form"

#Control
‚úèÔ∏è one can only control a body in the mind where it is imagined. In the real world control has no meaning as there are no separate objects.

### Rupert Spira

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">‚úèÔ∏è in Rupert's [[üòá5 Days With Rupert.canvas|üòá5 Days With Rupert]]
he starts off by "allowing all experience without controlling it in any way." The ego is always trying to change what is and control it.</mark>


‚úèÔ∏èIn one of Rupert's meditations he asks us to allow your experience without controlling it in any way. --That's a hard request. We simply want to jump into the experience and be in it rather than to be and surround it.



### ACIM

>Pause and be still a little while, and see how far you rise above the world, when you release your mind from chains and let it seek the level where it finds itself at home. It will be grateful to be free a while. It knows where it belongs. But free its wings, and it will fly in sureness and in joy to join its holy purpose. Let it rest in its Creator, there to be restored to sanity, to freedom and to love. -ACIM Lesson-128


### ACOL


### Jesus

"Be like a servant waiting for the return of the master," says Jesus.
"use your oil (attention) to keep your flame (inner connection, heart-space) burning brightly"
