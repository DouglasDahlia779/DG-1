## Pleasure gets us Stuck in the body experience.

Pleasure is another way to get stuck. The ego believes an experience is good. We like an experience so much that we re-enact it with our body-mind over and over again. We ignore Awareness during this and our identity becomes entangled in the experience.

We repeat the activity, and we get stuck there in a kind of feed-back loop. When inside this loop, we are oblivious to other layers of our being. We have become a body and have forgotten our greater Self. We don't see it, but it limits us. 

Our personality loves it so much, it creates a momentum in us to do it again, and again... we become the pleasure and forget that we are the one who experiences all.
