## Recognize yourself first

Find yourself first or recognize yourself first.

as the witnessing presence of awareness in the background of experience. Recognize yourself as that and be that knowingly.

If it is not clear to you that you are the witnessing presence of awareness in the background of experience.

> [!NOTE]
> You can just ask yourself a question such as What is it that knows or is aware of my experience?

And with this question, allow this question to invite the mind to relax the focus of its attention from the objective content of experience and to sink back Relax back into its essence.

I am not my thoughts, I am that which knows my thoughts.

I am not my feelings and sensations, I am that which is aware of my feelings and sensations.

I am not the world, I am that which perceives the world.

So in each of these three examples, I is the name that we give to the knowing or aware or perceiving element in all experience.

It is not something that we can know, be aware of, or perceive objectively.

The way to know the presence of awareness is to be the presence of awareness knowingly.

Of course, we are essentially the presence of awareness.

So when I suggest, recognize yourself as the witnessing presence of awareness. I am speaking to you, awareness.
You, awareness.

Recognize yourself.

Instead of shining the light of your knowing on the content of experience, relax your attention. Come back to yourself.

Remember yourself.

Recognize yourself.
