## How does the ego arise?

Now, the next question: How does the sense of being an ego or separate self arise.

What is the relationship between awareness, the finite mind, and the separate self? I use the words separate self and ego synonymously.

So far there's no problem with the finite mind. It is simply the means by which Infinite awareness unfolds itself as the universe. Not only is the finite mind not problematic It is as such the instrument of love, the instrument of creativity, through which The intelligence and the love that is the nature of reality unfolds itself in form, manifests itself in the universe. Not only is it not a problem, it is the instrument of Creativity and manifestation.

Now What is the relationship between the finite mind and the separate self, or the ego?

The separate self or ego is simply a thought that arises in the finite mind, not really in the finite mind, because the finite mind is not an entity.

The finite mind itself takes the shape of a thought which believes or states that" I, the finite mind am a discrete and independently existing entity or self in my own right."

With that belief, the finite mind seems to cease being simply the activity of infinite awareness and becomes, or seems to become, a discrete, independently existing entity.

Of course, it never really becomes such. It is just a belief.

That is the ego.

In other words, it is the equivalent of the dreamed character, the character in the dream that we seem to become, through whose agency we perceive the dreamed world.

It is as though the character in a dream were to assert I am a character independent of the dreamer's mind.

I have my own reality, my own independent existence!

This is absurd.

The dreamed character is simply the activity of our own mind, the activity through which, or in the form of which, we are able to perceive the activity of our own mind as the dreamed world.

The dreamed character never becomes a character. It just believes, or it doesn't believe, because it is not present to believe something.

Our own mind takes the shape of a thought, which says the dreamed character is a real character.

Likewise, that one of the thoughts that arises, the finite mind, takes the shape of a thought that says, I, the finite mind, exist independent of infinite awareness.

That belief alone is the ego.
