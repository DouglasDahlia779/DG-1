We are investigating the possibility here, that Reality (the world, the bodies) are Avatars in a Computer Simulation.

Today I made myself a hamburger. Did I decide to make it, or more specifically, did the person I think I am decide to make it? I will call him "the persona" in this note.

There is a difference between the person I think I am (the persona) and that which sees "the person I think I am."

This note will focus on if the persona, has free will to make decisions.

Having "Free Will" means having a choice from an infinite number of choices, but no one has an infinite number of choices. Instead the choices have all been pre-selected or simply are presented in their life situation, one after another. In one sense, the persona is following a script or a program.

How many ways can I make a hamburger? How I make it is predicated on my past, what the persona knows about this food, how it was made in the past, what goes into it in order that the persona likes it? etc. 

The important thing in the act of making a hamburger the way you like it is that after you've eaten it, you have confirmed to your own mind that you are a body in the world. The [[Servo Mechanisms in the mind]] of the mind have created this illusion.
