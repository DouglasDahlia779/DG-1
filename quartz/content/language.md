Language is meaningful in a dualistic world.
In non-duality, many words are meaningless.

What is "purpose" if everything is "one?"
Infinity is identical to the finite.
The beginning is the same as the end.
Going somewhere has no meaning. 

language was invented by ego to define itself as different that other things and other egos.
