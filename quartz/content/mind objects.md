Mind objects are made out of "being" or "awareness itself."
## What is existance?

>... We have to understand what is meant by existence. 

>So existence from the Latin EX, meaning "out of" and sisdari to stand implying that something that exists, stands out from what whatever it is that precedes existence. So anything that exists comes into existence, but what does it come into existence out of, what does it emerge from? 

>Being. Being precedes existence. And a thing that exists, stands out from being. In pure Being prior to existence, there is no form. And therefore there is no thing that can stand out with a name and the form, there is just being and being doesn't exist. 

>It is a thing that stands out from being in other words, a thing that comes into existence borrows its reality from being. 

>That is why a thing that exists or seems to exist seems to be real, it is real, but its reality is borrowed from its background.  --Rupert Spira
