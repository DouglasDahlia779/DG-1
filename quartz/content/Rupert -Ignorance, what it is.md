[#ignorance](app://obsidian.md/index.html#ignorance) = an activity of thinking and feeling, not an object

"Ignorance" is not an object that obscures the nature of Awareness, but rather an activity of thinking and feeling. The cessation of this obscuring activity is the process through which Awareness ceases to hide itself from itself in the form of mind, and recognizes itself as it is. 

The neti neti process is, therefore, a prelude to the deeper exploration of self-inquiry or self-investigation, leading to self-abidance or self-resting. In this self-abidance, Awareness is, in most cases gradually but occasionally suddenly, divested of its limitations and, at some point, stands revealed to itself as it essentially is.
