## Servo Mechanisms

Here we are investigating mental processes that support the idea that "I am a body"

A Servo Mechanism is a way of controlling something big by using a feed-back loop. If you move the body, you see the movement through your eyes, and feel the sensations of movement in your body. 

Body feelings through sensations are fed back into the mind. 
This is called "proprioception" - the sensory feedback they constantly receive from their muscles, joints, and skin, signaling the position of their bodies and limbs. [[Strangers to Ourselves]] pg19


Emotions
feedback loop of the body/emotions

Thoughts create feelings in the body.
When these feelings get identified with specific thoughts, then we say these are "emotional concepts," or "emotional thoughts."

For example the thought "I hate fish" can evoke a lot of emotion for a persona that has a very strong belief in this thought. (this means that he has used it, in part to define who he is.)

What if the truth is, there is [[no doer]].
