This is my [[Digital Garden]]. It is an experiential site on how reality operates. It will look at difficult questions with the purpose of finding clarity. 

I dedicate it to my friend, the late Dr. K.J. Stavrinides, who spent many nights, siting up with me late into the night discussing these kinds of questions, while his wife would make us coffee. His memory is a blessing to me.

♥️ There is a purpose for these words. The purpose is to investigate "thinking."
