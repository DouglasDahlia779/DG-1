Is there a purpose to life? This is one of the questions to be investigated here. This is my [[Digital Garden]]. It is an experiment on how the mind operates. It will look at difficult questions with the purpose of finding clarity. 

I dedicate it to my friend, the late Dr. K.J. Stavrinides, who spent many nights, siting up with me late into the night discussing these kinds of questions, while his wife would make us coffee.

♥️ There is a purpose for these words. The purpose is to investigate "thinking."
