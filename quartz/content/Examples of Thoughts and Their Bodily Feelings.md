## **Examples of Thoughts and Their Bodily Feelings**

| Type of Thought | Example Thought | Typical Bodily Feeling | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Fear / Anxiety** | “What if I fail this exam?” | Tight chest, rapid heartbeat, shallow breathing, butterflies in stomach | Fight-or-flight response activated by imagined threat |
| **Anger** | “They treated me unfairly.” | Flushed face, clenched jaw/fists, muscle tension, heat rising | Sympathetic nervous system arousal, adrenaline release |
| **Sadness** | “I’ve lost something precious.” | Heavy chest, lump in throat, tears, low energy | Parasympathetic dominance, slowing down of activity |
| **Joy / Excitement** | “I can’t believe this is happening!” | Lightness in chest, warmth spreading, smiling, tingling in limbs | Dopamine/endorphin release, high arousal positive affect |
| **Love / Affection** | “I care so deeply for them.” | Warmth in chest/heart area, relaxed body, soft gaze | Oxytocin release linked to bonding and closeness |
| **Shame / Embarrassment** | “Everyone saw my mistake.” | Hot face, stomach sinking, desire to hide, slouched posture | Blushing response, cortisol rise |
| **Pride / Accomplishment** | “I did it better than I thought I could.” | Expanded chest, upright posture, sense of strength | Often linked with serotonin and confidence signals |
| **Calm / Peace** | “Everything will be okay.” | Relaxed muscles, steady breathing, warmth in belly | Parasympathetic nervous system activation |
| **Anticipation** | “Tomorrow could change everything.” | Tingling in stomach, restless energy, pacing | Dopamine-driven readiness for action |
| **Guilt** | “I hurt someone I care about.” | Heavy chest, stomach knot, urge to withdraw | Often mixes with shame but more action-oriented |

**Insight**
- Thoughts trigger bodily feelings   
- This mind-body loop is central to how emotions are felt and expressed.

Here is a body map visualization showing how different **thought-driven emotions** manifest as feelings in specific regions:

- **Fear**: chest tightness, stomach knots, legs weak, hands clammy  
- **Anger**: heat in face, pounding chest, arms and hands tense  
- **Sadness**: heaviness in chest, throat lump, weak legs  
- **Joy**: warmth in face and chest, open arms  
- **Love**: warmth centered in chest/heart, gentle head/face glow  
- **Shame**: hot face, sinking stomach  
- **Calm**: relaxed chest, soft stomach, steady legs  

This follows patterns seen in neuroscience “emotion maps” (e.g., Nummenmaa et al., *PNAS*, 2014), showing how thoughts trigger embodied feelings across the nervous system.
