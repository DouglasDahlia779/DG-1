## pattern re-making

Thinking is not creative, it is pattern making from the mind objects of which you are aware. 

I learned that I was a body with a mind, but this too is a mind object, as I can see it there. 
Everything is in Awareness.

Computers use patterns of 1s and 0s to represent numbers or letters and the computer uses pattern modification to do everything it does. It also can search for patterns in large data bases, such as looking for a date.

AI uses pattern identification as well. It searches in a large data model for statistically close patterns, and can create new images or new text in this way. It mimics intelligence, but seen from this perspective "intelligence" is but a pattern recognition system based on the ego's likes and dislikes, it's temporary memory, etc.
