## Can a robot have a purpose?

Consider a robot maker who did not program any purpose for the robot. The robot won't do anything because it has no purpose. 

Consider now if the robot maker wanted the robot to **think for himself,** then the purpose would be "**to see what happens if the robot thinks for himself.**" 

The first problem will be to find a way for a program to think about itself and it's operating container. The robot maker will have to find a way for the robot to create a self-identity. He needs to be programmed for "I am" before he can learn about other objects and actions between objects, and without the sense of "I am" he can not develop his own purpose.

Can a robot have a purpose for itself? -no, not today

- any purpose that is, is in the mind of the that which believes in the purpose
- the Creator may have a purpose for the created, but it is in His mind
- the Creator may have a purpose for Himself, but that too is in his mind
