## thoughts are self-organizing

>-Edward de Bono describes them (thoughts) in the brain/mind memory surface as "self-organizing," that is, thoughts organize themselves into patterns based in the "design goals of the system."

 >Once this has happened then the memory-surface only needs a clue from the environment to call forth the already established patterns. 
The two processes are not distinct or separate. There is always a balance between the two. The balance may be one way or the other.

>It is okay to see the patterns which emerge in the content of life. It is okay to see them, but do not give a belief that they are separate. Do not give a belief that the separation is real. This belief can only come with belief in what the mind is saying about the so-called other. The simple way to say it is ‘Enjoy it as a dream, or enjoy it as a movie’. Then all this uniqueness, all this beauty can be enjoyed. All the tastes of the world can be enjoyed without us getting caught up in the maya of the world. Getting caught up in the maya only means that we believe that it is real. We give it a belief that it is separate from me.
