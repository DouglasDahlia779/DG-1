[[Recognize yourself first]]


Be with yourself.

Be as yourself.

Our knowledge of ourself, that is, awareness's awareness of itself.

This is the simple, ordinary, intimate experience to which we refer When we say simply, I am.

Before "I am" is qualified by experience.

That is, before I am becomes I am this or I am that.

In other words, the experience I am.

refers to our naked being before it is clothed in experience.

And just as we tend to lose touch with our naked body when we get dressed in the morning.

So we tend to lose touch with our naked being when it is clothed in experience.

But just as it is possible for us to return to the experience of our naked body any time during the day without getting undressed, so it is possible for us to return to our naked being at any time during the day without changing or getting rid of any experience.

Simply <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">be with the experience of being.</mark>


## be with the experience of being.

Which is another way of saying simply know being.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Be aware of being</mark> and then at some point there is this great revelation that either strikes us in a moment or gradually dawns on us, namely That the awareness of being is happiness itself.

Now having recognized yourself as the presence of awareness that lies behind your experience.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Feel yourself as the space-like presence of awareness</mark> within which your experience arises.

understand and feel that the presence of awareness is like a borderless Space, a vast openness, within which the entire content of experience arises. including the flow of perception, flow of sensations that constitute our experience of the body. and the perceptions through which we perceive the world.

Instead of believing and feeling that The body is in the world and the mind is in the body and awareness is in the mind. We understand and feel that the body, mind and world Appear in me, awareness I do not appear in them. And now understand and feel that everything that appears in awareness is made of awareness just as all the waves and currents that appear on or in the ocean are made only of water.

Awareness itself has no form, no inherent form, but assumes all the forms of experience.


## Why do I believe i am an ego?

Now we might ask a question if I am Formless, infinite, indivisible awareness.

Why do I believe and feel that I am a temporary, finite, separate self?

And as a result, suffer.

So I would like to try to answer this question.

Both how and why do we seem to become a temporary finite separate self or ego?

And I would like, I will do my best to try not to become philosophical, but to explain this in a way that enables us to follow in our actual experience, not just intellectually.

So first of all, why does the infinite seem to become the finite?

[[why does the infinite seem to become the finite]]

[[Why can't Infinite Awareness know the world directly]]


![[Divider_3.svg]]

So reality itself, infinite consciousness, is present prior to the finite mind.

But it is through the finite mind that reality appears as the world.

And [[this was beautifully expressed]] by the romantic poet William Wordsworth when he was describing the world.

And he referred to the mighty world of eye and ear, that the world that we perceive, the mighty world of eye and ear both what they half create and what perceive.

So he's saying that the faculty of perception half creates The world we perceive, but half perceives the pre-existing world.

In other words, reality, the reality of the world pre-exists the finite mind, it is infinite consciousness, but the appearance of the world is derived from the finite mind and appears in accordance with its limitations.

So the world as we know it is both created and perceived through the finite mind.
It is perceived because the reality of the world is what is really there.
In that sense, the finite mind perceives, or awareness perceives what is really there, through the finite mind.

But because awareness looks through the glasses of the finite mind, the finite mind superimposes its own limitations on reality and makes it appear as the world.

So the finite mind both creates creates the appearance of, and at the same time perceives the reality of The universe The mighty world of eye and ear both what they half create and what they perceive So this answers the question, how and why is the finite mind created?

Why?

In order to allow reality to appear as the universe in order to allow infinite consciousness to manifest its potential in form.

How?

By infinite awareness localizing itself as the activity of perception and thought.


[[How does the ego arise]]

## Suffering

And all our suffering, and by suffering, please understand I don't mean pain, I don't mean resistance that arises on behalf of the safety or the well-being of the body, of our body, or the body of one who is in our care.

I don't consider that to be suffering.

When I speak of suffering, I mean psychological or emotional suffering.

Let me just pause here and make a very clear distinction between [[pain]] or distress that arises on behalf of the body, and suffering which arises on behalf of the illusory separate self or ego.

Physical pain or distress rises on behalf of the body.

And one of the ways to distinguish between the two, if you are in any doubt, is that physical pain or or distress, that is, resistance that arises on behalf of the safety or well-being of the body, does not require the support of thinking.

If you are in physical pain The physical pain does not depend upon thinking. You can be in intense physical pain without having any thoughts.

Likewise, if you are hungry, there is an inherent discomfort to the experience of hunger.

Hunger is supposed to be mildly uncomfortable, except in extreme cases, of course. Hunger is supposed to be uncomfortable. We are supposed to resist it, because that is what makes us respond by eating. If our house is on fire, we don't need to refer to thought. to resist the situation, the resistance to the situation, is a natural instinct that arises on behalf of the preservation of the body.
Pain, hunger, an emergency in the environment.

None of these experiences require the support of thinking.

That's one of the ways, a very clear way of determining whether or not our resistance arises on behalf of the body or the separate self.


## Jealousy

Now, take the experience of jealousy. The body can be in a perfectly healthy, satisfied condition. when we feel jealousy. So the jealousy does not arise on behalf of the body, and the jealousy obviously does not arise on behalf of awareness. The jealousy arises on behalf of an imaginary self that is created with the thought, I am a separate, independent entity.

And it is not possible for jealousy to exist without thinking. This is one of the ways of distinguishing, a very effective way of distinguishing between pain or distress.
And psychological or emotional suffering.

Psychological and emotional suffering always requires thought to support it.

And the primary thought, which lies at the heart of all psychological or emotional suffering, is the separate self-thought.

I am a temporary, finite self.

In other words, all our afflictive emotions Arise on behalf of an illusory self.

So I hope I have made it clear in an experiential, not just a philosophical, way, the relationship between awareness and the finite mind and the finite mind and the separate self or ego.

Of course these are not Three separate things. The finite mind is the activity of infinite awareness, and the separate self or ego is the active is a single activity of the finite mind.

Now, I hope that this analysis that I have given will also answer another question that is often asked.

Namely, how is it possible to live in the world in a way that is consistent with the non-dual understanding.

To which my answer is, how is it possible to live sanely in the world without this non-dual understanding?

Because it is not the activity of the finite mind that comes to an end when we recognize our true nature. It is one tiny part of the finite mind, namely the belief that I am a temporary finite self that comes to an end.

All the rest of the faculties of our finite mind continues. The finite mind is simply washed clean of the belief I am a temporary finite self and all the other beliefs that spring from that primary belief.

That aspect of our thinking gradually disappears. on the recognition of our true nature. But the activities of thinking and perceiving that constitute each of our finite minds continues. The activity of thinking and perceiving is simply cleansed of the distorting filter of the sense of separation. and as a result, it functions much better in the world.

A finite mind becomes The means by which the nature of reality Peace, love, beauty, intelligence, happiness, peace is expressed in the world.

Such a mind, that is a mind that has been cleansed of the belief of separation, becomes an instrument. through which reality or infinite awareness manifests its innate qualities.

In life, in experience And all the qualities that we most admire in human beings. Kindness, dignity, compassion, empathy, generosity. Humour, affection, justice, peace. Equity. All these qualities are qualities that are the inevitable expression of a mind that has to a greater or lesser extent been washed clean. Of the sense of separation, courage would be another one.

In other words, all of these qualities, the qualities that we most admire in human beings, are not really human qualities, they are divine qualities.

They are the qualities of the divine.

Expressing itself through a human being and as such. being shared in humanity, with humanity, and all the qualities that we least admire. In human beings, I don't need to list them. Are those qualities that are filtered through a mind? in which the belief in separation is still active or present.
In other words, these qualities that we least respect in human beings Are how the divine qualities of intelligence, peace, love, beauty appear When filtered through the sense of separation That's why the Shankacharya, Shantananda Saraswati said, even hatred is a manifestation of love.

It's why the experiences of grief and love are so closely associated. In other words, grief is really love tinged with a sense of separation. Our sorrow is really our happiness veiled by the sense of separation.

And that is why, this is why, in this approach. All we really do is investigate the nature of I, the nature of ourself. Everything depends on our knowledge of ourselves.

It is not possible to have right knowledge of anything before having right knowledge of ourself.

It's why the words [[Know thyself]] were carved above the entrance to the Temple of Apollo in Delphi two and a half thousand years ago and stand as an invitation to humanity.

To recognize the nature of reality, the nature of ourself, the same understanding that lies at the heart of all the great Eastern wisdom traditions. 

The recognition of the nature of ourself puts an end on the inside to all afflictive emotions, puts an end to our suffering, but it doesn't stop there. It flows out.

This knowledge flows out from inside us into the world in the form of all the qualities that we love and admire: Justice, tolerance, compassion, empathy, kindness, generosity, Courage, affection, and so on and so on. 

All these qualities are simply the inevitable manifestation. Of the recognition of the nature of ourself. 

Peace and happiness on the inside love Beauty, compassion, kindness, tolerance on the outside.
