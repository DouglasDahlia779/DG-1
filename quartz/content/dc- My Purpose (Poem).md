# My Purpose

To muse is but a thought  
Without direction here;  
What purpose that, Confusious asks,  
for this must be so clear  
  
For purpose is important,  
More than one well might know;  
For it defines the future  
That we are about to know;  
  
What is it that we look for ?  
What are we searching for ?  
-To find ourselves, -to fill our lack  
-To see beyond the door  
  
The door of limitation,  
-A wall obtuse to me;  
You ask "why I can not see?"  
Maybe the cause is me!  
  
For God is Love Incredible  
Nothing kept for himself;  
She offers All to everyone,  
To me as well, myself!  
  
So why am I delaying ?  
Why wait the gift of All ?  
-My fear is what does keep me,  
here stuck behind the wall;  
  
So look at this but gently,  
my fear's of Love not death  
but totally mistaken  
is an error made in jest;  
  
You made a joke pretending,  
As little children do,  
Pretending you were not of Love,  
Yet all there is is You,  
  
Then you forgot to smile at it,  
To see how it was not,  
And ran to form specific,  
From Mind not kept apart  
  
Believed a sin created,  
Survival was the goal,  
To live apart from everything  
Trade A body for a soul,  
  
A plan to keep one mindless  
Forget the sin beneath  
Now live in space specific  
Awaiting my release  
  

## Thoughts
#thoughts/drc

Are thoughts important?  
What do they accomplish?  
Is their main purpose to define the self you think you are?  
Do they try to convince you that you are separate from everything? Unique in the world?  
  
  
Watch them and see what's hiding behind them!
