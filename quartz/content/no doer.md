I AM NOT THE DOER

✏️ as soon as you accept that you are the doer of deeds within the world, you create the guilt that comes with it automatically. ACIM and guilt must talk about this too. connect this idea to the "doer" you think you are.

> If I am not the "thinker of the thoughts" then I am not the doer of the action.

"you are not the thinker of the thought, nor the doer of the action" [[Ananta -Don't Believe Your next thought]]

also [[Ananta -You Are Aware Now]]

"if you can watch the doer, how can you be the doer?" [[001 Spirit insights]]

>10. What is the end of the path of knowledge (jnana) or Vedanta?  
It is to know the truth that the ‘I’ is not different from the Lord (Isvara) and to be free from the feeling of being the doer (kartrtva, ahamkara). [[Spiritual Instruction -SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI]]
