We are investigating the idea that a person becomes identified with his thoughts and then believes he "is" the thinker of the thoughts.

Inside this belief, (in this state of his belief) (he sees things he believes are true, facts -undeniable facts) (he considers ideas of others as opinions, hut his are facts) (he sees what he is looking for) he sees that he is the cause of the thoughts. 

[[Servo Mechanisms in the mind]] in the mind set you up to forget you are in the mind. 

He believes that he is free to choose, but his choices in reality are very limited. They are limited by what he knows, what he experienced in his mind. 

"What he knows" starts first with his language. 

([[Can one think without language?]]) For every word he learned as a child, he has his own understanding of meaning. Words are connectors to past experiences or to other words and experiences. 

Experiences here can mean mental experiences, and indeed [[all experiences are in the mind]].
