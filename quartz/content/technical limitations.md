# on Quartz4


- images do not get posted on the web.
	- they are in /bins and need to be moved into \_Quartz
	- they need to be explicitly added to git (?)

- frontmatter is visible on the web version
	- 

I am using Quartz4 to convert my notes in Obsidian into HTML, but Quartz does not recognize ".canvas files" i.e. diagrams made that was, so if published, I'll have to publish an image of the canvas.


[[Digital Garden technical options]] -Canvas files are not recognized by Quartz
