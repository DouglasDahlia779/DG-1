## ACIM Ideas Dissolve your beliefs

-Awareness has no form, or all forms are within it
-forms (objects) have no awareness, or awareness is all around them
-if I am, what beliefs are needed? 

-if I do not know myself as "no thing" then ideas need to direct the mind back
- "I am not a body, I am free, for I am still has god created me"
