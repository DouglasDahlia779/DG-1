## Death connects us to Emptiness

I was thinking about the strange [[Eckart Tolle -on Zen "Emptiness"| emptiness]] and silence that is felt when someone close to you dies. Alan Reid affected me that way. A death always does. They are completely identified with the silence now, every potential, all knowledge, all love. Our connection to them brings us into the void too. It is an opening into the Kingdom of Heaven, outside duality. Awareness takes our attention there.

there can be a subtle resistance to going to Awareness, a fear that sacrifice is required... look at this fear thought with acceptance. "Vision has no cost to anyone... it can only bless" -Lesson 27
