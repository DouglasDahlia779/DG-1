Our dreams resemble what we have experienced when we were awake within our personal reality. When we awaken, and if we remember the dream, we find that while it seemed so real during the dream, it was all fictitious. It is as if we were watching ourself -an actor in a movie and the film broke just before we woke up. Time in the dream is clearly an illusion. Maybe the actors too.
