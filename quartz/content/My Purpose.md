My purpose is to train the seer to see that which does not change. This is another way to say "dissolve the ego," and stay identified with Awareness. 

[[The Lord's Prayer from ACIM]]


[[purpose (definition -ACIM)]]

From the point of view of a student of ACIM, these notes are to [[generalize the lessons|synthesize]] ACIM's teaching so that I will listen to the Mind of Christ (the Right mind) instead of the ego (the wrong mind). 

What this means to me, beyond the religious language of ACIM is to listen with your heart... to listen with all your being... to be open... 

> [!important]
> Thoughts of SEPARATION are contrary to Yoga

> " To be free of thoughts contrary to yoga (yoga means: "to unite"), opposite thoughts must be cultivated."

- Patangali_Yoga_Sutras  2.32

> [!NOTE]
> "Yoga practice is the willful effort to restrain the five activities of mind and abide in a state of stillness." Patangali_Yoga_Sutras  1.13

‚úèÔ∏è Right Minded thoughts are thoughts that support the activity of stillness.

>Learning aims at change, and that is always its purpose..." (ACIM T-8.I.4.) 


‚úèÔ∏èBut realize that "that which changes" is not the truth. It is the seer who sees the change who is of the unchanging.  I am that one. The one who sees the changing self trying to learn the message of Spirit.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The change sought for, is to change the way I see myself. </mark>This is not a change on the outside, but rather a change in the mind, a change from the inside. It is a change of identity. It is letting go of the one I think I am. 

I want Awareness to recognize itself. To recognize this, I must look at more than at only phenomenon that comes and goes. I have to allow myself to see what does not change, the Awareness.

In the language of ACIM, these notes are written so that **the thoughts I think I think**  become purified, i.e. I won't assume them to be "my" thoughts any longer, and thus "I will be free of thoughts contrary to yoga" (Patangeli 2.32 above)  I will see the body, the person, the thoughts from the perspective of the Seer. All of these will be seen as part of the activity of the mind. 

The question "what is [[Reality, what is it|reality]]" is answered by the experience of it, not by thoughts in the finite mind.

[[üòáSpiritual Seeing Canvas.canvas]]

In the language of Eckart Tolle, "who is this person that I can not live with?"

In the language of Mooji, "stay in your true perspective and the old self will burn in the white fire." Be the one who looks at both: the self searching for God, and the self searching for pleasure.


A powerful idea from ACIM is "Thought reversal."  [[ACIM Workbook#^d8436e|Lesson 126]]. Experientially, it is a change in direction, from looking outward for more experience to looking inward at the seer. It is also a change from [[Spirit/Projection|Projection]] (of the world) to [[extension]]. It also is a change from separation to unity.

The ego identity is as Mooji says, "unstable and always changing". It can speak one moment from a place of fear, and the next moment from a place of love. At times love shines through it. At other times love is hidden in the layers of mind. ACIM calls this [[Split Mind|"the split mind". ]]  

Mooji encourages us to seek what is already stable within us, "Beingness." Jesus through the [[Gospel of Thomas -notes|Gospel of Thomas]] encourages us to stay in "beingness" and let it consume the "lion" (the ego). See: [[beingness,  in the Gospel of Thomas]].

>(3) Jesus said, "If those who lead you say to you, 'See, the kingdom is in the sky,' then the  birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will  precede you. Rather, __the kingdom is inside of you__, and it is outside of you. [[Gospel of Thomas -notes]]
>When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living father. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in  poverty and it is you who are that poverty."   


#ACIM_split-mind 

The ego speaks out of fear, from a place of limitation. The Holy Spirit speaks out of a place of fullness, connection, and love without limit. These are both sides of a split-mind. (ego mind and Beingness mind) How one speaks is a result of the source of those thoughts, the "I" who speaks them. We vacillate between feeling connected, and feeling separate. We vacillate between the two aspects of our spilt mind. So the [[moving in the world|goal]] is to not only change one's self-image from a body to Awareness, but also to remain there as Awareness and become consistently identified as Awareness.

Of course many words can be substituted here for "[[Awareness or Thinker|Awareness or Thinker]]": Spirit, Beingness, Self,  Space Consciousness  etc.

Enlightened masters speak from the Self.


Miracles are thoughts. ACIM T-1.I.12 And when we can perceive the difference between [[thoughts that are True]], vs. [[thoughts that are False]], our choices are indeed miracles.
Because we recognize the false, we let these ideas fall away. We begin to think with the mind of Christ. We no longer attack ourselves, as we recognize that we have been forgiven of error, and we automatically pass on the forgiveness to others. ("Miracles are examples of right thinking, aligning your perceptions with truth as God created it. ACIM T-1.I35")

[[Right Thinking]] is a good first step in the process of returning to God, and away from compulsive thinking.  It is a kinder way to teach those lost in "their" thoughts. Rupert Spira would say, Right Thinking is a concession to the mind. It will lead you to "no-thought." That is the real purpose of thought. 

‚úèÔ∏è Out of "no thought" comes 'thought' and it dissolves back to "no thought"

‚úèÔ∏è "the motivation for this course (ACIM) is the attainment and the keeping of the state of peace." T-24.in.1 [[Chapter 24. THE GOAL OF SPECIALNESS#Introduction]] In this state the mind is quiet. 

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">God is remembered when the mind is quiet. </mark>

God did not give me a special purpose, different than others. 

>T-24.I.7. Your brother is your friend because his Father created him like you. There is no difference. You have been given to your brother that love might be extended, not cut off from him. What you keep is lost to you. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">God gave you and your brother Himself, and to remember this is now the only purpose that you share.</mark> And so it is the only one you have. Could you attack your brother if you chose to see no specialness of any kind between you and him? Look fairly at whatever makes you give your brother only partial welcome, or would let you think that you are better off apart.











 [[Reality, what is it]]. 

‚úîÔ∏è watch the ego/mind when it jumps to "automatic mode"  ... it is the Seer that sees this. I am not the mind.

In terms of opinions, the ego stops on the the first pattern it has previously identified, convinced that it "knows". 
This is not learning. This is arrogance. #arrogance

The next step after "Right Thinking" is being in union with God. This requires nothing at all, as I always am in union with God. Awareness is always here. It is here before there is any thought. All it has to do is recognize itself.

>"When you return to your original form of communication with God by direct revelation, the need for miracles is over. T-1.I.46" This is the goal of miracles. 


‚úèÔ∏è Ideas that lead me to Beingness are indeed miracles.  This is like saying "Stop thinking" and then you don't need miraculous thoughts to bring you home.

"Every day should be devoted to miracles! " T-1.I.15

‚úèÔ∏è I am not what I see, I am that I am.

Just look now and see if this is true. In Beingness, thinking has stopped. 

It actually has to stop because the act of thinking is forgetting you are Awareness. 

Abide here. Sink into it. [[Welcome_Home]]

## Experience of Unity

The experience of unity is required to change our belief system. [[ACOL 18#^b70577]]
It is therefore very important to experience the unity of the Kingdom and to recognize the Self so that my spit mind will be healed.

ACIM Lesson 128 recommends three meditations of ten mins each every day in order to loose the mind from what it values ( [[my values]] ) here in the world. 


## Direction
‚úèÔ∏è The ego directs you in every direction except inward. It looks into objective "reality", outside yourself so that you do not look at yourself. ==Real change comes from a change in direction== (ACIM T-8-1-6) from outside to inside. It is the seer inside that needs to become your teacher, not the ego body/mind that plays in the projected world. If I listen to both my ego and my inner teacher, my mind will be split about what reality is. ACIM T-8-1.6

"you will end up in the direction you are going, unless you change direction" -Confucius

"the Kingdom is at hand, don't wait for some future time" -Jesus (Matt 4:17) (Mark 1:14)

"the journey to the Kingdom, is a journey without distance." -drc

The ego says "determination will make me one minded."

Spirit says that "I am already one minded."

>‚ÄúTo be in the company of those whose minds and hearts are turned towards the Truth is to be in the company of holiness. Don‚Äôt hold on to any image of what freedom should be like or how your life will change. Throw all these things overboard. Just present yourself at the feet of God with a big Yes inside your heart.

>Say, ‚ÄòYes. I‚Äôm helpless without you. Rid me of ego and merge me in you. I‚Äôm here only for this. I don‚Äôt know any way or path. You are my refuge.‚Äô

>Come to the shrine like this‚Äî- empty.‚Äù
