## things to give up:
- the sense that I have rights see: Mooji [[Rights -give them up]]
- give up pride, the sense that "I know how to do it"
- give up future, there is no future
- give up the past, it was just patterns
- give up dependancies (who will look after me)
- give up your story so God will direct
- give up planning, have trust in God's direction
- give up searching for beauty.


>"After a while, you are no longer the carrier of thoughts.
You don't have to create an immigration counter for thoughts. You're like a land with no name, without borders. Your space is always infinite, panoramic, wide.

>You're only happy in your own silence. You don't need things to enjoy yourself. Joy of being yourself. It's okay to give up everything and just be." -Mooji
