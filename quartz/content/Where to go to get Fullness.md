✏️ desires arise from one's sub-conscious [[the littleness principal|Littleness]], as does the desire to re-connect with God.  

✏️ "thirsty" in the above quote from John could be easily changed to "empty." 

This refers to a recognition of one's emptiness and advice to change one's attention towards one's heart, --their "Being," outside of the sensory world. It is a simple invitation into the emptiness of Being, and outside of thought.
