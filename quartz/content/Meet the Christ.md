## Meet the Christ

How would you like to meet Christ? To be with him? You can.
Just invite Him. Then move your awareness into your mind and rest there.

Thoughts will come. The attention will follow them. Remind yourself that the world changes, and is in mind and move your attention back to the non-specific. Awareness. 

If you have to do something, let the body do it. Even the body is in the mind. Watch everything from Awareness.

If you find yourself as the doer, recognize the error and move your perspective back into Awareness watching the doer. You are not the doer.
