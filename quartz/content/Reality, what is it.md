# [[Reality according to Science]]
# Spirit: What is Real 

To the HS the reality of anything in the world is only the service it renders God on behalf of the function He gives it. T-8.VII.3. 

-   Reality does not change; illusion changes
-   Spirit does not change; bodies and Egos are always changing
-   Knowledge is constant; Perception changes
-   Being is constant [[_Quartz/Being]]; 
-   Reality check; 
	- what God has made can not be used. 
	- What you made can be used. 
	- -ACOL 9-10 "To use" something is an idea in a dualistic system.
-   Only the "I Am" is real. It is constant. 

- from the point of view of the finite mind, reality is broken up into separate objects and self. [[episode 73 podcast with Andre Duqum]]

- the belief that 'I am a body' interprets one's experiences as divided: 
	- -inside experiences (thinking, imagining, feeling) and 
	- -outside experiences (perception); self vs others
- the self wears a mask of a body/person


>All things which are called definite and solid are but relative, for only that which is subject to change appears definite and solid. The created world is subject to change...
