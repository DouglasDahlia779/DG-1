mental momentum

- the mind mostly sees old patterns that it has seen before. 
- it can imagine new patterns, but mostly does not.
- learning to recognize new patterns requires attention to go back and see them again and again
- unlearning uses the same attention, but with a new "Interest Quotient" -the interest the seer has in this

We awaken. What do we think about?


We don't remain thought-less for long. Ever wonder why?

There is something that wants to be something inside us. We don't like to be empty. 

Yet being empty is a state that has no problems. It is the "enlightened state." In this state we can watch thoughts. We can watch phenomenon. We can watch what changes. We can feel the vibration of the body, the background noise we hear. 

The same old. Yes, what we thought about yesterday, and the day before, and the day before that. Why is that?

It's because we set in our mind: what we like, verses what we don't like and this makes an impression we remember with the tag "good" or "bad."

These impressions, like photographs are seen again and again. We even dream about them.

We get caught in our past and these images. But how can we see things a fresh? How can we see a new day as it is, "A new day"? 

One way might be to let go of what we like, and what we dislike, and just look. To be "born again" would be a good way. Imagine you are a baby the moment your eyes open in the morning.  Stay out of past thoughts and remain just as a seer.

What do we see? The light coming through the window. Your partner's presence. Or maybe your partner's absence. The warmth of the blankets, or the cold of the morning air. 

When thought arises, we think of the fears of yesterday, or the possibilities of today. If we stay in presence, without thought, we see without discussion, without judgement, without rejection. There is no problem.

If we think, then problems arise. 

But the thinker can be directed by your intention. This can change everything. Ask yourself, "what do you want to think about?"

Answer this with the good, the blessed, the endearing, and see what will happen. Make this a habit, and see what happens.
