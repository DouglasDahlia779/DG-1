## Awareness or Thinker

üëçüèø Awareness ignores itself when it's thinking. 

To Awareness, the act of thinking is ignoring itself. 

This is what [[Rupert -Ignorance, what it is]] means in the Vedas. 

This is because we are awareness [[Studies/Being]] , or we think as an ego.

(Rupert Spira meditation)  [[Rupert_Transparent Body, Luminous World -Bk|see here]]

There is a choice to be made here.
1. I can just "Be" without thought, (focus is non-phenomenal) or 
2. I can think, and project myself into a body with feeling and all the human qualities of fear, and hope...

In this way I can realize my true Self, or 
[[I can delay my return home by thinking]]
(this is just an idea in the mind, I am already home)
