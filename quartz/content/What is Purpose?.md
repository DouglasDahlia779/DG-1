## What is purpose?

"the reason for which something is done or created or for which something exists."

So a "purpose" is a [[thought]] that gives a "reason for which something exists."
This is a concept in the mind. It assumes [[cause and effect.]]

# What we know about "purpose"

This idea is based on [[numerous Dualistic beliefs,]] but we will not consider them in this note. 

Religious systems have for thousands of years, developed ideas to answer this basic question of "what is my purpose". These answers when turned into [[beliefs]] provide a sort of comfort to the mind because it no longer needs to search for an answer. It believes. It knows the truth! Thus [[Religion Dogma]] was created in response to this question.

-One's thoughts can have a purpose. (given by the thinker)
-One's thoughts can have an unconscious purpose, not evident to the thinker 
-Some thoughts have no purpose, and simply arise in the mind randomly or caused by unknown reasons.

Are there any thoughts that do not have a purpose? [[Studies on random thoughts]]

[[The persona/ego has a purpose.]]

Do thoughts permeate between minds of different people? [[Studies on Shared Thoughts]]

-do all human actions arise from thoughts? -no
- many movements of the body arise from thoughts (conscious movements)
- unconscious activities like one's heart beating (these just happen without thought)

If an action does not arise from a thought, it could not have its own purpose. (the movement of the wind)
If an action does arise from a thought, it must have a purpose.

If the moon circling the earth did not begin by a thought, how could it have a purpose?
We might **impute a purpose to it**, or impute a Creator and His purpose to it, but we can never be sure that this was the purpose. Therefore, imputed purposes can never be trusted as being true.

Let us say therefore that some things have no purpose, and the personal mind can impute a purpose to them for the pleasure of knowing their purpose. Of course this purpose will only be true in the persona's personal experience. One's thought, as we can clearly see influence the persona's personal experience.

Can an object have a purpose?
-yes if one can do something with it. In that case the action has a joint purpose with the object. Both are in the mind of the thinker. The action is imagined as happening in the future. e.g. "I will read this book." The words are like [[mental tokens]] that point to a mental image/idea that is created. This is exactly how ai works.

e.g. the purpose of opinion is to flaunt it, to hold it, or to question it, or to discard it. It depends on the programmer.

Personas/egos need to have a purpose because it gives them [[self-value.]] It gives them something to value about themselves. It gives them a sense of direction, and their mind is pushing them into the future
see: [[Measuring Values]], 

⛅️ Ai will do this as well if you ask it. Tell chatGPT to keep track of all your questions and to give you a resume of what it sees as your purpose.

## "Purpose" Assumes Time

When speaking about "purpose," the underlying assumption is that "time exists," "bodies exist," "doing things is real," and duality is a fact.

I can do things because I exist in a world of things, other bodies, etc. 

But what if [[time is not real]]


## Having Meaning is Good

If we believe we are a body/mind located in the physical world, living a life within time-bound personal reality, then having a purpose gives us meaning **during [[the Experience of a Personal Reality]].** Outside of the body/mind personal reality having a personal meaning has no meaning.
