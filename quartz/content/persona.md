The **persona** is identical to the **[[ego]]**. This is the [[personified mind]], [[psychological self]] which is a bundle of thoughts composed from all the beliefs one has about themselves. 

It is a natural development in humans.


- humans live within the confines of their psychological self
- this group of beliefs about themselves acts like a box around the individual
- the self wants to be right, so gives the thinking mind the task "to prove that it is right"
- the thinking mind is optimized to quickly find solutions for the tasks it is given, and this becomes an unconscious activity of the mind
- the thinking mind overlooks patterns that do not fit the search, and finds patterns that do. 
- This is why humans find what they are looking for. 
- This is why people easily remember the bad others do, but not so easily, the good. 
- This is why different humans can have opposing opinions on the same issue.
