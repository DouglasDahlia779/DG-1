## why does the infinite seem to become the finite?

And the answer is this, or one answer is this.

The infinite by itself, being infinite, is formless.

It is a realm of infinite potential.

In which all forms lie in potential.

But in order to manifest This infinite potential in actuality as a universe.

Infinite awareness must seem to become a finite awareness or a finite mind.

Because it is only possible to know or perceive a finite universe or a finite object from the limited perspective of a finite subject.

In other words, the infinite cannot know the finite directly.

It must do so through the agency of a finite subject or finite mind.

In exactly the same way that when we fall asleep at night, we cannot perceive the dreamed world directly.

We have to seem to become a character in the dreamed world, from whose point of view or through whose sense perceptions We view the activity of our own mind as the dreamed world.

So, in exactly the same way, I would suggest that each of our [[finite mind]]s And by finite mind, I mean the activity of thinking and perceiving.

Just pause to recognize this in your experience, your current experience.

Your current objective experience is a mixture of thinking and perceiving. That's all there is to our individual experience, thinking and perceiving --and by thinking and perceiving, I include all feeling, sensing, imagining, etc.

So just as the dreamer's mind views the dreamed world through the Sense perceptions of the dreamed character that it seems to become, so infinite reality or infinite awareness perceives itself or its own activity as the universe, through the sense perceptions, or through the finite mind that is each of us.

And this is why, when thinking and perceiving come to an end, as they do in deep sleep, there is no experience of the world. It is not possible for awareness to experience the world if not through perception.

Perception is the is like a pair of glasses, the faculty of perception, is like a pair of glasses that awareness puts on that enables it to perceive itself as the universe.

The faculty of thinking is then added to the faculty of perception, like a pair of clip-on dark glasses. Awareness then clips on the faculty of thinking to the faculty of perceiving and it is with thought that we divide up what we perceive into numerous objects and selves.

So thought is like a a lens that is placed on top of the lens of perception, and there is a fine grid on the lens of thinking, which fragments what is perceived into an apparent multiplicity and diversity of objects and selves.

So between them, perceiving and conceiving, (perception and thought), are like the filter, the glasses that awareness puts on that enables its formless self to appear in form or as form and thinking refracts that form into a multiplicity and diversity of objects and selves.

In other words, the faculties of perception and thought are the means by which the one appears as many. Or, in religious language, the means by which God's infinite being appears as the universe.

Now, please notice that at this stage, we haven't said anything about a separate self or an ego. We've just spoken of unlimited awareness, formless, infinite awareness, and the finite mind, that is, the faculties of perception and thought.

Now, before going on to address the question as to how the sense of the separate self or ego develops from the finite mind.

I'd like to answer one question.


Why can't Infinite Awareness know the world directly?
