Most personas believe they are their bodies, and the story about themselves that they carry in their mind is real. 

This seems to be the natural way we all develop from early childhood into adulthood.

The mind does not recognize itself as a bundle of thoughts, but as the actor in their own mind. When the actor speaks, the belief is that it is "the actor" speaking, and that any thoughts are "the actor's thoughts." When the actor acts in the mind, the belief is that the persona acts in the world. In this way the physical [[illusion of the world]] is created because it is not recognized that it is in the mind.

## The Experience of our life Experience

Two Phases of Life Experience

The experience of living seems to have two phases, like night and day, [[asleep]] and [[awake]]. In the sleep activity, we have [[dreams]] and period of no dreams. In our waking period we also can have day dreams, and no dreams. Both phases are similar and different.
